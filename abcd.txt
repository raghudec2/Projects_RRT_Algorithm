Read Me : Implementatation of RRT Path Planning Algorithm : 


Steps to Execute the Program : 

1.	Download the files : RRT_Main_Driver_Logic.py and RRT_Root_Logic.py
2.	Import them in your IDE : 
3.	The program is developed by importing random, math and pygame libraries.
4.	Install the necessary libraries.
5.	Debug the program  file - RRT_Main_Driver_Logic.py 
6.	Execute the Program.
7.	The output is show in a separate window.
 



Program Files and Required Libraries : 

File : RRT_Main_Driver_Logic.py and RRT_Root_Logic.py
Libraries : import Math, Random, and Pygame.


Logic : 

In RRT_Main_Driver_Logic.py  Change the following parameters for
Keying  the required dimensions, start /goal and obstacle dimensions and no of obstacles : 

dimensions = (600, 1000) #Enter the Dimensions of the Map
start = (50,50)          #Enter the Start Point Coordinates
goal = (510, 510)        #Enter the Goal Point Coordinates
obsdim = 50              #Enter the Obstacle Dimensions
obsnum = 3               #input for entering the required No of Obstacles on the map
